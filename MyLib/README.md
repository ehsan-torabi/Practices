# Data Structure Libraries

This folder contains various data structures that I have implemented in C++ for my personal use. The data structures include:

- **Stack**: A simple stack that uses an array as the underlying data structure.
- **Queue**: A normal queue that uses an array as the underlying data structure.
- **Circular Queue**: A circular queue that uses an array as the underlying data structure.

I am planning to update this folder soon with more data structures that use a linked list as the underlying data structure.
